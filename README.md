# PROGRAMA LOCALIZADOR TEMPORAL FISICO

This program was made for a final work from a college subject. The name of the subject is "Conceitos de física A", in english physics concepts the ideia of this subject is give to the student a better way to see the world, with new eyes, diferent of what regular schools use to teach, so with José Garcia, a very good professor, i could have a different vision of what physic is. So in the end of this subject Garcia ask for each student create something that no one ever created with the knowledge given by the subject and present to the class, some of my colleagues created a card game, others a book review as olds physicists and other things. I decided to creat a situation that is a world where the timeline got broken and a huge group of people got lost in different times, so to fix that problem a company called "JAR' created "JARGPT" a artificial inteligence that recognize the timeline of the person by his knowledge of physic. I made this program with C++ and was pretty fun do this project!
